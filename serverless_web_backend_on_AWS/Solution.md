# Architecting the solution steps:
In this solution we will provide an ecommerce company with a backend web service on AWS.
We will be taking in consideration the customer requirements and the problems that they are
trying to solve with this migration.
Then we will design this solution for this use case by implementing AWS services.

### Customer requirements:

1. Managed scaling for compute and database components.
2. Decoupling components to maximize resilience.
3. Centralized monitoring and logging
4. Optimizing for cost, performance efficiency and operational overhead.

### Attacking the problem:

1. Compute requirement:
To have a managed and scaled compute service we have to use serverless services
